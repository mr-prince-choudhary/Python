Method 1: Using for Loop
Code:-
number,sum = 6,0
for i in range(number+1):
  sum+=i
print(sum)

Output:-
21


Method 2: Using the Formula
Code:-
number = 6
sum = int((number * (number + 1))/2)
print(sum)

Output:-
21


Method 3: Using Recursion
Code:-
def recursum(number):
  if number == 0:
    return number
  return number + recursum(number-1)
number, sum = 6,0
print(recursum(number))

Output:-
21
