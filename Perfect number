Method 1: Using Simple Iteration I
Code:-
n = 28
sump = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    if(n % i == 0):
        sump= sump + i
if (sump == n):
    print("The number is a Perfect number")
else:
    print("The number is not a Perfect number")

Output:-
The number is a Perfect number


Method 2: Using Simple Iteration II
Code:-
n = 28
sump = 0
for i in range(1, int(pow(n,0.5))):
    if(n % i == 0):
        if i == 1:
          sump+=i
        elif  i == n/i:
          sump+=i
        else:
          sump+= i + n/i
if (sump == n):
    print("The number is a Perfect number")
else:
    print("The number is not a Perfect number")

Output:-
The number is a Perfect number
